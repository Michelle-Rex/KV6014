We don't have a medication table only a log

Design considerations:
	move the sidebar stuff to the very bottom of the page, we could probably make a sticky to do it for us


Pending tasks:
	make a table for it
	make some functions like get_pending_task_count or get_pending_tasks_by_patientID
	put these functions in their respective pages

Medication:
	make a medication table, even if it is handled nicely by a calender system we still need a place to store it
	add functions like get_todays_medication_count or get_todays_medication_by_patientID



There will be more to do but I am only focusing on the Dashboard for now and we can move outwards from there

Tables to add:
	pending tasks
	medication
	todo
	notification	- For family members
	reminder	- For carers

Database related:
	Update the sql functions to use the proper db.py functions rather than just conn.execute
	The idea of Incremented UIDs is nice but also if stored in session data you could just increment your own ID and pretend to be someone else, so it is a security issue perhaps? We should think of something better to do
	to notify the family I will need to:
		In carers log page they should have a button which sends the message when a log is made
		select familymemberID(s) -> insert into notification familymemberID, Message
		
		

login:
	the checker for the login just uses the session_state boolean to check if you are logged in and doesn't do any verifying at all
	login page is a prototype so very barebones
	Important Note: I discovered that every "cookie" or "cache" is serverside so kind of impossible for a client to manipulate it, so session state is tied to the user's "session token" which is what a client sees.

handling multiple patients:
	It is worth noting that due to trying to keep with the previous design the dashboard now handles multiple patients in a sense, we should seperate this somehow

Accessibility:
	Maybe a reset button?
